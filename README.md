The AUM CS INC.ubator is a project begun in January of 2018 for computer science students at Auburn University of Montgomery to conceptualize, develop, and code into finished projects new ideas, or advancements of existing ideas.  These projects will be chosen from the ongoing members of the INC.ubator, and developed to fruition.  The over-arching idea behind the incubator is to take real, useful, and marketable coding projects through the entire software development cycle.
